----------------------Understand the Problem-----------------------
THINGS TO CONSIDER:
  -If any part of the problem is unclear, ask for clarification.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a program that can generate the lyrics of the 99 Bottles of Beer song. See the test suite for the entire song.

EXPECTED INPUT:

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

EDGE CASES:
  -
  -
  -

RULES (make sure to check for things not explicitly stated):
  Standard verse:
  - X bottles of beer on the wall, X bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, X - 1 bottles
  of beer on the wall.
  - If 1 bottle of beer left use singular bottle
  - if 0 bottles left use no more
  -
  -

QUESTIONS:
    However, Jest was able to find:

EXAMPLE:



EXAMPLE:

------------------Data Structures and Algorithm--------------------
BeerSong class:
  constructor: no args
  set beerCount to 99


  verse instance method: takes at min 1 arg optional 2nd arg
  - log the verse with beerCount
  - decrement beerCount by 1
  - log the verse with beerCount - 1
  - If beer count equals zero print no more
